Animal Detection Web Application with Real-Time Notification System

This project is a full-stack Object Detection Web Application developed using the Flask web framework and YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once), one of the most advanced and efficient real-time object detection models currently available. The application is specifically tailored for detecting animals in live or uploaded video feeds.

Upon detection of a target animal, the system automatically sends an email notification to the registered owner, alerting them in real time. This functionality can be particularly useful for scenarios such as wildlife monitoring, pet tracking, or surveillance in areas where animal presence needs to be recorded or acted upon.

The project features a modern and responsive front-end interface, designed to offer an intuitive user experience. Through the dashboard, users can view:

Live or recorded detection results,

A searchable and filterable detection history,

Image snapshots of detected animals,

And the corresponding timestamps.

Additionally, the application includes a well-structured relational database (using SQLite/MySQL), and showcases the implementation of advanced SQL queries for data management, such as retrieving detection analytics, managing user accounts, and filtering detections based on time, type, or location.

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

Computer Vision and Deep Learning using YOLOv8,

Back-end development with Flask,

Front-end integration (HTML/CSS/JavaScript),

Email automation with SMTP,

Database design and complex SQL querying, and

Building complete, production-ready machine learning applications.

It serves as a strong example of how AI-powered detection systems can be integrated into real-world, user-friendly platforms with practical value.
